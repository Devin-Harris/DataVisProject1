            The motivation for this project was to illustrate potential
            correlations and trends between different economic, environmental,
            behavioral, demographic, and health related factors across all the
            U.S. counties. The goal of the project was to help people understand
            how these factors can influence each other while also providing
            quantitative data to each U.S. County.

              >https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas/index.htm</a

            As you can see there are 3 different views (1 for each chart type).
            I then have a global form on the left-hand side that provides
            attribute changing, grouping/aggregating, and in some cases sorting
            functionality. I wanted to make these controls shared between the
            different chart types as much as possible to make switching between
            them feel more fluid and keeping the same selections between charts.
            The most interesting thing about this form section to me is the
            grouping functionality. Upon looking at the data I found that
            showcasing datapoints for all 3000+ counties would be difficult in
            some cases. Thus, I wanted a way to limit the number of datapoints
            for these instances. By grouping all the counties into their
            respective state, or urban rural status I can reduce the number of
            datapoints to render dramatically. This led to the question of how
            should I group them? Should I average all the datapoints together?
            Take the maximum value? This is where the group by aggregate
            selection came in. This allows users to not only group datapoints
            together but decide how to aggregate the values of that group as
            well. You may also notice that when the bar chart is selected, there
            are some additional selectors.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first is a slider to denote the minimum width of each bar in
              the bar chart. This was created after I realized rendering two
              bars for each county (1 for each attribute selected) required more
              space than my laptop had to assign even 1px to said bars. Thus, I
              added a minimum width of 150px to each bar and allowed horizontal
              scrolling on said chart. This helps in cases where there are a lot
              of bars on the chart but detracted from the ability for users to
              see overall trends. Allowing them to decrease that min width pulls
              more data points into view to better assess those overall trends
              (with the drawback of potential x-axis overlapping).
            </li>
            <li>
              The second is a sorting selector. This was created again to help
              assess that overall trend I mentioned in the point above.
              Assessing which county/state has the highest/lowest value in the
              bar chart was difficult before this selector. With it, sorting
              allows you to pull the highest or lowest values to the left most
              points on the graph which also help show the general slopes of
              whichever attribute you are sorting over. Alphabetical sorting
              also helps users find a specific county/state/urban rural status
              they are looking for without having to scroll blindly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is also a legend section to help illustrate what colors line
            up to what groups or values, again depending on chart type. The
            following rules were followed for this legend and color scheme
            building within the charts:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Scatter plots color their dots based on the state if the group by
              is county or state. This is because a legend with a color for
              every county was hard to sift through and did not seem to help the
              visualization. If group by is urban-rural-status the 4 statuses
              are used as the legend domain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bar charts color their bars based on attribute. I decided to show
              bar charts as two bar per x axis tick because it helped to compare
              the two attributes per county/state/urban-rural-status easier.
              This of course led me towards keeping the colors consistent
              between attributes to better showcase how they compare across
              different points on the x-axis.
            </li>
            <li>
              Choropleth maps used a green and blue sequential scale for the 1st
              and 2nd attribute selected respectively. This helps differentiate
              the two maps without having to label which map is showing which
              attribute while also showing the geographical hotspots/lowspots
              for each attribute across the United States.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Finally, the choropleth maps behave in an interesting way. At first,
            I wanted to display two maps side by side (1 for each attribute) but
            quickly realized that horizontal scroll would be needed to do this
            and comparing over scroll felt incorrect. Thus, I opted to add more
            controls on the right-hand side to allow the user to toggle how the
            coloring is applied to a single map (based on the first or second
            attribute depending on how many times the toggle button is clicked).
            This prevents the user from having to sift their eyes across two
            different maps when they want to compare those hot/low spots I
            mentioned above while also giving more screen real estate to the
            map. This chart also allows for selecting counties (which show up in
            that right hand side as well as with a border highlight on the map)
            for easy comparing between these two attributes as well.

            <p>
              Above I selected “Education &lt; Highschool %” as my x-axis and
              “Poverty %” as my y axis. Grouping by state we then see that on
              average the more people with less than high school education the
              more people there are in poverty (in general)
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="images images-nowrap">
            <img src="./assets/images/P1-Discovery-2.png" />
            <p>
              Above we see that the average “% of smokers” per state does not
              really translate to the average “air quality” per state, which
              seemed a little suprising.
            </p>

              And finally, above you can see the west has substantially more
              park access than the east.

          <p>
            There are some improvements I would liked to have made to this
            project given I had the time. Firstly, I wanted to be able to click
            the legend swatches on the bar and scatter charts to hide/show
            certain data points. This would have allowed a lot more narrowing of
            comparisons, which I think could be useful. I also would have liked
            to utilize the selection I did on the maps with the other charts.
            Maybe selecting counties over any chart could show up in the
            right-hand side regardless of chart type? My main question on that
            was how would changing the group by selection affect that. If I had
            counties selected, then switched to selecting states I would
            probably have to clear the previous selection which I haven’t
            decided if I’m ok with thus why I didn’t do it.

          <p>
            For this project I used d3, svelte, and typescript. I unfortunately
            was told this was not allowed late into the project. Reasons being
            for consistency between projects and other classmates. I however
            have javascript experience and wanted my portfolio to showcase a new
            skill so hopefully this does not detract from the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because I used svelte I built components for each of my chart types
            instead of the class based approach the vanilla JavaScript examples
            provided. I then had a form component and utilized svelte stores to
            share the selections from this form to the chart components as they
            changed. This opened the door for me to provide wrapper container
            components that conditionally rendered one of the charts based on
            the chart type, and automatically regrouped the data and
            reinitialized the chart components when the group by or group by
            aggregate values changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can run it by cloning the project, installing Node and Npm,
            running “npm install” in the terminal from inside the cloned
            directory, and running “npm run dev” to start a local instance of
            the project.
